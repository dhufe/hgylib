# Overview
Code allows to read volumetric data produced by the Hilgus software. In the meaning of ultrasonic investigations, volumetric means two independent spatial coordinates and a position synchronized time signal (e.g. an amplitude scan, A-Scan).

# Usage
Some proof of concept code is attached in the *src* directory and is able to read the data files and will prompt the containing information to *stdout*.
